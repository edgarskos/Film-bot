## Indroduction
There are a lot of tedious edits to perform on wikipedia and I was looking to help out the film project by automating them. The [requirements list](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Films/Bot_requests) was long and [the approval](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approval/CinemaBot) didn't go very well. Surprisingly it all works quite well.

## To Build
I've programmed this with python 2.7 but you will also need [pywikipedia](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikipediabot) and [imdbpy](https://bitbucket.org/alberanid/imdbpy) installed.
